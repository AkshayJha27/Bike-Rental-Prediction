# Bike-Rental-Prediction
In present scenario rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort.
Therefore it is important to ensure the availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public at the right time as 
it reduces the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes 
a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply 
of rental bikes.
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), 
the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
